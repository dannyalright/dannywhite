Digital product designer available for freelance and contract work.

Availability starting mid November 2021.

Most recently I was a Staff Designer at Kickstarter, where I led the design for its iOS and Android applications. I also led design for Kickstarter's environmental work, including the [Environmental Resources Center]({% link _work/environmental-resources-center.md %}), and help design the project creation experience.

At ustwo, I helped create and foster projects with the likes of Facebook, Nike, Google, GE, AT&T, and the Office of the Mayor of New York City. The digital platform we began for the Office of the Mayor of New York City went on to receive an Adobe Government Creativity Award in 2018.

At Facebook I helped the Design Tools team bring Origami to life; contributing software design and creating the internal and [external learning experience](https://origami.design/tutorials){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} (tutorial videos, examples, and their interconnections) that live on today. I also worked on the Interfaces team at Facebook, where I created the company's first Origami component library and helped envision Facebook product UI changes.

And then there might be links down here to other things I do on this site...
