My home on the internet, built on [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev).

## Sass

### Style

Follows the Sass [7-1 Pattern](https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern).

### Architecture

Loosely based on [11ty Sass Skeleton](https://github.com/5t3ph/11ty-sass-skeleton) by @5t3ph.

### Reset

I vendored a version of [the-new-css-reset](https://github.com/elad2412/the-new-css-reset) by @elad2412.

## Development Scripts

**`npm start`**

> Run 11ty with hot reload at localhost:8080, including reload based on Sass changes

**`npm run build`**

> Production build includes minified, autoprefixed CSS

Use this as the "Publish command" if needed by hosting such as Netlify.
