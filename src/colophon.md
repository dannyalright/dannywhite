## Eleventy

This is hopefully where the footer link to 'Eleventy' goes.
I use [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) to make my site.

I'm such a fan of Eleventy that you should read [all my posts tagged with it](/notes#todo).

## Carbon measurements

This is where I go in detail about the carbon measurement in the website footer.
