Did you know billy carts used to be drawn by billygoats, hence the name? Me neither.

Enlightened today at the National Library of Australia, at the [Fit to Print](https://www.library.gov.au/whats-on/exhibitions/fit-print-defining-moments-fairfax-photo-archive/) photo exhibition. Verified, of course, [on Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_cart#/media/File:Young_boy_in_a_billy_cart_outside_a_Queenslander_home_at_Indooroopilly,_Brisbane_ca._1910_(16741023054).jpg>).

One of those words thatâ€™s so embedded that you never think to question its origin.
