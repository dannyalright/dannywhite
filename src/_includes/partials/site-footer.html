      This page weighs in at 10g CO<sub>2</sub>e<sup>*</sup>. That's about the
      same as growing a single carrot and driving it to a nearby supermarket.
      Sparse use of imagery, limited fonts, and other tricks help bring it down.
      I dream of a soon-to-be-real world where a clean electrical and HVAC
      supply would mean serving this site — and all others — results in zero
      emissions.
