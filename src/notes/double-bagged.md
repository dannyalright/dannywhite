Does this corn last longer if shrink-wrapped and cushioned in styrofoam?
Does it survive the bumps of the road better?
Will more people buy it than regular, in-husk, corn?

Let’s go one shelf over.

“Covering the stems on bananas makes them last longer” they say.
Okay, sure.
But this?

I find it hard to believe that the extra materials and time it takes to bag these bananas outweighs the money saved from possible shelf-life extension.

I leave you with one last blood-boiler: The infamous styrofoam egg carton.

Eggshells [break more](https://wamu.org/story/19/04/05/the-very-scientific-egg-carton-test/) in foam than in plastic or (the champion) cardboard.
So why do eggs get an exception[^1] in [New York’s styrofoam ban](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/site/resources/recycling-and-garbage-laws/collection-setout-laws-for-business/foam-ban)?

Many questions.
(Probably) few good answers.
Much work to do.
