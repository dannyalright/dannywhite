Some things I've picked up along the way:

- Read the termination clause and factor it in. I never took it seriously until a recent project where it got enacted. I'd just committed to office space and said no to other opportunities. Had I realised it was even a thing I'd have had backups ready.

- Don't buckle on your rate. Except for charity.
