It's been just over two years since I (re)started my freelance practice. Here are some things I've learnt along the way:

- Carve out your own niche. The broader your offering, the more competition you have.

- Get comfortable with selling yourself. Then get good at it.

- Don't buckle on your rate. Except for non-profit work. Ideally increase it with every engagement.

- Try to work only on projects that push you upward. Poor-quality projects both burn you out and deteriorate your portfolio.

- Actively carve out holidays. Otherwise they will revolve around the whims of clients or never happen at all.

- Keep a regular routine between gigs. Use that time to update your presence or scratch an itch.

- A project isn't 'on' until both sides have signed the contract. Don't start without it and keep pursuing other jobs until it lands.

- Even with a signed contract, understand the termination clause. Prepare for the case in which it gets enacted.

- Surround yourself with other makers. Freelancing gets lonely, particularly when done at a distance.
