Some things I've picked up along the way:

- Get comfortable with selling yourself. Then get good at it.

- Understand the termination clause in each contract. Prepare for the case where it gets enacted.

- Don't buckle on your rate. Except for charity.

- Carve out your holidays. Otherwise you'll never take them.

- Similarly, set your own schedule or your life will revolve around the whims of (potential) clients.
