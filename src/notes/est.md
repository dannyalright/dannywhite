We recently rode the Empire State Trail from Manhattan to Rouses Point, continuing on to Montréal, Canada. The trip took 11 days at a relaxed riding pace.
What follows is some advice and a route recap aimed at folks planning a similar trip.

If you're just looking for an answer to "should I do the Empire State Trail?" I say yes.
Going from New York City to Albany seemed doable with most bikes and a general fitness level.
If you're just looking for the ride data, see my pre-ride Ride With GPS route collection [here](https://ridewithgps.com/collections/45795?privacy_code=FQSqiW1RcXuLBATK) and links to my Strava ride logs [below](#our-route-in-detail).

## Advice

Here's what I wish I knew before leaving:

1. Go after Memorial Day
2. Know your daily cadence
3. Warm up before the trip
4. Pack utensils

### Go after Memorial Day

Consider your timing and plan accordingly.
Know that stores and restaurants in small towns can be shut until Memorial Day (late May). From what I hear, they stay open until at least Labor Day (early September), maybe even to Thanksgiving (late November).

If I could do it over, I'd plan to leave New York City a day or two before Memorial Day so we hit the small towns _just_ as they open.
It gets hot and crowded later in June when school breaks up.

We went in early May which turned out to be earlier than most towns were open for season.
That meant we would sometimes struggle to find places to eat or stock up on groceries.
It also limited our range.
For example: we could have taken a ferry and explored Vermont had we been on the road a few weeks later when that route opened.

### Know your daily cadence

You will likely find yourselves travelling over a weekend, in nice weather, in sparsely populated areas.
Oh, with a big backlog of post-COVID weddings and local events like paper mill closures.
Seriously.
All that means accommodation may become sparse.

Figure out how many miles you and your entourage can (or want to) comfortably ride per day and calculate which towns you'll want to stay in.
Make bookings at least a few days ahead—particularly for weekends—so you can adjust your upcoming milage if necessary.
Try to make refundable bookings so you have more flexibility.

Our (comfort) cadence ended up being around <span class="distance inline">70 to 100 km</span> per day.
That looked like riding from 9:30am to about 3:30pm with plenty of breaks in between.
We alternated the longer days with shorter ones when geography and hotel availability allowed for it.

Keep in mind that cadence will be affected by elevation.
That is a serious factor once you pass Albany and enter the Adirondacks. You can reference my [Ride With GPS route](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/39225143) to plan both the distances and elevation gain for each leg.
Google Maps is surprisingly good for this too as it tends to stick to the Empire State Trail route.

We didn't figure out our cadence until a few days into the trip and got stung on a Saturday arrival in Hudson, NY where hotels were almost booked up.
The remaining one or two were widly expensive.

### Warm up before the trip

Practice in your full kit and fully-laden bike before the trip.

Get at least one <span class="distance inline">50 km</span> ride in or—even better—an overnighter or two.
You might discover parts of your bike (or body) that need adjusting.
It's much better to get injured or experience mechanical issues whilst at home than when on the road, miles from the closest bike shop or hospital.

I accidentally bled my hydraulic brakes when replacing brake pads.
Luckily this happened a few weeks prior to the trip, where I was able to both get the fluid refilled and have another skill added to my bicycle mechanic repertoire from the comfort of home.

Lukas wrecked his Achilles during the ride because he used a slightly different saddle height and wore cleats he hadn't used for a while. We were well on the way so he had to push on.

### Pack utensils

Many hotel breakfasts, cafes, diners, and even restaurants outside the major cities in the US serve food, drink, and condiments in disposable packaging.
The trail of landfill we produced was shocking.

The metal cutlery and a KeepCup I brought along avoided some waste and came in handy for the occasional roadside grapefruit.
A camp-grade plate and bowl would have completed the package and avoided a lot more of our waste.

## Our route in detail

We did the _Hudson Valley Greenway_ to _Champlain Valley Trail_ parts of the Empire State Trail and some of the Canadian _La Route Verte_ to Montréal.
We didn't do the _Erie Canalway Trail_ and didn't camp either.
We stayed at hotels that struck a balance between affordability and proximity to the trail.
Think _Motel 6_, _Holiday Inn Express_, and the like.

Here's a daily breakdown of our ride.

### Manhattan to Ardsley

Five of us left the [Battery Park starting point](https://goo.gl/maps/J83fTqYqjVKPQ9oR6) on a Monday morning.
The ride out of the city was only difficult between Inwood and the Bronx: where we left the Hudson River Greenway and hadn't yet reached Van Cortlandt Park. The rest of the day—actually the entire ride to Albany—was peaceful, scenic, and mostly separated from cars.

<figcaption>Closing in on Ardsley. This is generally what the trail looks like after the Bronx.</figcaption>
</figure>

From here on for the _entirety of the trail_ I don’t think we made a wrong turn or felt lost.
Kudos to the trail planners as the signage is well placed.

We stopped loading the GPX file on to Lukas’ Garmin after a few days and instead occasionally referenced an offline copy of my [Ride With GPS route](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/39225143) on our phones.

</div>

We spent our first night at a motel in Ardsley, just off the trail's path.
I chose Ardsley because <span class="distance inline">44.52 km</span> seemed like a modest distance for our first day: buffering some time to warm up, repair flats, and wait for latecomers.

If I could do the trip over I'd pick somewhere further up.
Ardsley was too short of a ride and an awkward for walking around in.
Riding a bit further to reach a nicer hotel and/or nicer town soon revealed itself to be worth the effort.

### Ardsley to Brewster

Day two matched the (rough) average daily pace for the trip, at <span class="distance inline">68.89 km</span>.
We rode from Ardsley to Brewster along the North Country Trailway.
Existing rail trails like this one seem to make up the bulk of the Empire State Trail to Albany.

As per Ardsley, had I followed my own advice to ‘know your daily cadence’, we would have pushed on (or hung back) and stayed somewhere more walkable for food and supplies.
The inn was beautiful but in a deadzone for non-drivers like us.

### Brewster to Poughkeepsie

Riding long distances was already getting easy by the third day, where we rode <span class="distance inline">67.12 km</span> to Poughkeepsie.

</figure>

The Maybrook Trailway from Brewster became the Dutchess Rail Trail at Hopewell Junction.
Both trails were relatively flat, well-maintained, and scenic.
I'm glad we didn't go any quicker so we could take it in.

Poughkeepsie, on the other hand, was not much to behold.
We instead took a cab to FDR's presidential library and museum and spent the afternoon there.
You can also cycle this (albeit along a busy road) in about 30 minutes from downtown Poughkeepsie.

### Poughkeepsie to Kingston

This was a rest day, going only <span class="distance inline">45.63 km</span> to Kingston.
I'm glad we had low milage because there was a lot to see.

We took about thirty minutes crossing the Mid-Hudson Bridge (just after Poughkeepsie) because it was so damn scenic, and then loitered in New Paltz for the coffee and food.

</div>

The Wallkill Valley Rail Trail after New Paltz was the first unpaved surface we encountered.
No worries though as the gravel was compact and well-maintained.

This was one of my favourite legs of the trip.
Riding under canopy.
Cold air pockets that felt like air conditioning but was just an abandoned mine with leftover frost.
You round a corner and there's the most picturesque bridge you've ever seen.

</div>

A short section of the trail was under repair about 10 minutes north of Rosendale, but I'd expect this to be repaired by now.
Walking our bikes through was easy enough.

### Kingston to Hudson

We said goodbye to Myles after Kingston and continued on <span class="distance inline">45.63 km</span> to Hudson.
He rode part of the way with us (back over the Hudson River) and then on to Rhinecliff to catch the train back home.

Riding through the Bard College area was particularly beautiful.
Being on the open road—for the first time on the trail—with little traffic had a lot to do with that.

### Hudson to Albany

Only now after leaving Hudson did it feel like we were in the 'sticks'.
That didn't last long though, as we picked up our average cadence to ride
<span class="distance inline">68.34 km</span> to Albany.

The entire day's ride was done on the unpaved Albany-Hundson Electric Trail.
All of the (albeit short) unpaved legs to this point were compacted and well-maintained.
I think you could do it on any bicycle.

  </figure>
</div>

### Albany to Schuylerville

<span class="distance inline">65.99 km</span>

The entire trail until now has been tame.
It could be done easily with most bicycles, but not for much further...

Things started getting tough after Albany.
But more rewarding also.

Elevation-wise, terrain, and in terms of road safety. This is where I think you’d need at least 28mm tyres. I rode 43mm gravel tyres and was thankful or it.
And you also need a solid level of fitness to get through tese never-ending hills.

We stayed in a shipping container.

### Schuylerville to Ticonderoga

<span class="distance inline">105.54 km</span>

We swam in Lake Champlain.

### Ticonderoga to Westport

<span class="distance inline">46.51 km</span>

We climbed hills and hills and hills.

We got stuck in a ghost town but were lent a car.

Essex town. Willsboro diner interactions.

### Westport to Plattsburgh

<span class="distance inline">77.96 km</span>

We crossed the Ausable Chasm.

### Plattsburgh to Rouses Point to Saint Jean-sur-Richelieu

<span class="distance inline">84.16 km</span>

Got flat after Plattsburgh.

Rouses Point is uneventful. Maybe that's the rain talking and making me grumpy.
But the surrounding area is nice. Lakey.
You can see Vermont.

Empire State Trail done. Underwhelimg finish line.
Hello Canada.

Good roads and nice drivers, despite the rain.
Nice cycling paths.

Crappy weather but the ride was nice.

Saint Jean-sur-Richelieu.
Cool town.
Walkable. Charming.

### Saint Jean-sur-Richelieu to Montréal

<span class="distance inline">53.83 km</span>

Canal bike path on gravel.
Coffee in Chambly.
Busy bike paths.

New-looking bike path from Montréal suburbs direct to town.
Some parts still under construction.

### Unwinding in Montréal

I'm glad we rode the extra 1.5 days to Montréal.
It's a beautiful city.
It's also one of the best cities for cycling I've been to, so save some of your energy.
And put aside at least a few days.

Although I expected a B-grade city to rest my legs in, I found myself riding similar distances as during the trail (<span class="distance inline">70 to 100 km</span> per day).
Cycling was just the best way to see the city and get around.

It also seems like _[La Route Verte](https://www.routeverte.com/en/)_ has some promising rides if you wanted to continue on through Québec.

## Other resources

I found these resources helpful during the planning phase of the trip:

- [My Ride With GPS routes](https://ridewithgps.com/collections/45795?privacy_code=FQSqiW1RcXuLBATK)
  - [Empire State Trail](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/39225143)
  - [Rouses Point to Montréal](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/39236591)

- [Interactive map](https://empiretrail.ny.gov/map)
- [BikeEmpireState Cue Sheets](https://bikeempirestate.com/cue-sheets.aspx)

Once we were on the trail we followed an offline copy of my [RWGPS route](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/39225143) and heeded advice from locals.

Oh, and you should grab a free physical copy of the trail map from the official site’s [Request a Map page](https://empiretrail.ny.gov/request-map).

## Birds

For the twitchers out there: if there were a bird mascot for the trail it would be the [Red-Winged Blackbird](https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/red-winged-blackbird).
It was the only bird that followed us the whole way.
