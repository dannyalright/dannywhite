We recently rode the Empire State Trail from Manhattan to Rouses Point, continuing on to Montréal, Canada. The trip took 11 days at a relaxed riding pace.
What follows is some advice and a route recap aimed at folks planning a similar trip.

If you're just looking for an answer to "should I do the Empire State Trail?" I say yes.
Going from New York City to Albany seemed doable with most bikes and a general fitness level.
If you're just looking for the ride data, see my pre-ride Ride With GPS route collection [here](https://ridewithgps.com/collections/45795?privacy_code=FQSqiW1RcXuLBATK) and links to my Strava ride logs [below](#our-route-in-detail).

## Advice

Here's what I wish I knew before leaving:

1. Go after Memorial Day
2. Know your daily cadence
3. Warm up before the trip
4. Pack utensils

### Go after Memorial Day

Consider your timing and plan accordingly.
Know that stores and restaurants in small towns can be shut until Memorial Day (late May). From what I hear, things stay open until at least Labor Day (early September).
Maybe even Thanksgiving (late November).

If I could do it over, I'd plan to leave New York City a day or two before Memorial Day so I hit the small towns _just_ as they open.
It gets hot and crowded later in June when school breaks up.

We went in early May which turned out to be earlier than most towns were open for season.
That meant we would sometimes struggle to find places to eat or stock up on groceries.
It also limited our range.
For example, we might have taken a ferry to Vermont had we been on the road a few weeks later when that route opened.

### Know your daily cadence

You will likely find yourselves travelling over a weekend, in nice weather, in sparsely populated areas.
Oh, with a big backlog of post-COVID weddings and local show-stoppers like paper mill closures (seriously).
That means accommodation may become sparse.

Figure out how many miles you and your entourage can (or want to) comfortably ride per day and calculate which towns you'll want to stay in.
Make bookings at least a few days ahead (particularly for weekends) so you can adjust your upcoming milage if necessary.
Try to make refundable bookings so you have more flexibility.

Our (comfort) cadence ended up being around <span class="distance inline">70 to 100 km</span> per day.
That looked like riding from 9:30am to about 3:30pm with plenty of breaks.
Geography and availability permitting, we would alternate the longer days with shorter ones.

Keep in mind that cadence will be affected by elevation.
That is a serious factor once you pass Albany and enter the Adirondacks. Use my [Ride With GPS route](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/39225143) to plan both the distances and elevation gain for each leg.
Google Maps is great for quick calculations as it tends to stick to the Empire State Trail route.

We didn't figure out our cadence until a few days into the trip and got stung on a Saturday arrival in Hudson, NY where hotels were almost booked up.
The remaining one or two were widly expensive.

### Warm up before the trip

Practice in your full kit and fully-laden bike before the trip.

Get at least one <span class="distance inline">50 km</span> ride in or—even better—an overnighter or two.
You might discover parts of your bike (or body) that need adjusting.
It's much better to get injured or experience mechanical issues whilst at home than when on the road, miles from the closest bike shop or hospital.

I accidentally bled my hydraulic brakes when replacing brake pads but thankfully did this a few weeks prior to the trip. I was able to both get the fluid refilled and have another skill added to my bicycle mechanic repertoire from the comfort of home.

Lukas wrecked his Achilles by the end of the trip because he used a slightly different saddle height and cleats he hadn't ridden long distances in for a while.

### Pack utensils

Many hotel breakfasts, cafes, diners, and even restaurants outside the major cities in the US serve food, drink, and condiments in disposable packaging.
The amount of landfill we produced was shocking.

The metal cutlery and a KeepCup I brought along avoided some waste and came in handy for the occasional roadside grapefruit.
A camp-grade plate and bowl would have completed the package and avoided a lot more waste.

## Our route in detail

We did the _Hudson Valley Greenway_ to _Champlain Valley Trail_ parts of the Empire State Trail and part of the Canadian _La Route Verte_ to Montréal.
We didn't do the _Erie Canalway Trail_ and we did not camp.

We stayed at hotels that struck a balance between affordability and proximity to the trail.
Think _Motel 6_, _Holiday Inn Express_, and the like.

Here's a daily breakdown of our ride.

### Getting out of the city

<!-- #### Manhattan to Ardsley -->

Five of us left the [Battery Park starting point](https://goo.gl/maps/J83fTqYqjVKPQ9oR6) on a Monday morning.
The ride out of the city was only difficult between Inwood and the Bronx: when we left the Hudson River Greenway and hadn't yet reached Van Cortlandt Park. The rest of the day—actually the entire ride to Albany—was peaceful, scenic, and mostly separated from cars.

<figcaption>Closing in on Ardsley. This is generally what the trail looks like after the Bronx.</figcaption>
</figure>

From here on for the _entirety of the trail_ I don’t think we made a wrong turn or felt lost.
The signage is incredible.

We stopped loading the GPX file on to Lukas’ Garmin after a few days and instead occasionally referenced an offline copy of my [Ride With GPS route](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/39225143) on our phones.

We spent our first night at a motel in Ardsley.
I chose Ardsley because <span class="distance inline">44.52 km</span> seemed like a modest distance for our first day (buffering for warming up, flats, and latecomers).
The motel was also just off the trail's path.

If I could do the trip over I'd pick somewhere further up.
Ardsley was too short of a ride and an awkward town for walking around in.
Riding a bit further in a day to reach a nicer hotel also revealed itself later in the trip to usually be worth the effort.

<!-- #### Ardsley to Brewster -->

The next day we rode <span class="distance inline">68.89 km</span> to Brewster along the North Country Trailway.

Had I followed my own advice to ‘know your daily cadence’ we would have pushed on and stayed somewhere more walkable for food and supplies.
The inn was beautiful but in a bicycle ‘deadzone’.

Poughkeepsie is a weird town. Not much to see here.

Hop on your bike (or grab a cab like we did) to see FDR’s presidential library.

<!-- #### Poughkeepsie to Kingston -->

Take your time crossing the bridge.
It's got plenty to see.

Stop into New Paltz for a sandwich and smoothie at X.

A bit of compacted gravel around New Paltz. Leaving New Paltz felt like leaving the city in some ways.
Very beautiful ride.
Cold air pockets that felt like air conditioning but was just an abandoned mine with leftover frost.
Bridges in the middle of nowhere.

Kingston is a nice little town.

Hotel with arcade through the window.

<!-- #### Kingston to Hudson -->

We said goodbye to Myles.
He hopped on the train back to NYC.

We rode through the Bard College area.
On the open road yet safe.

I think this (and early tomorrow) was my favourite day because you had the safety of sparse traffic mixed with being on the open road: being able to see more.
That's the one downside to rail trails: it can get a bit boring. I want to see the sights, the houses, the mailboxes as I pass.

Cows. Black bears.

Did I say beautiful?

Then we rolled into Hudson...

This is the night we got stung by not heading my ‘know your daily cadence’ advice once more: we had to stay somewhere expensive.

### Heading towards Albany

<!-- #### Hudson to Albany -->

Okay, now we felt like we were leaving some psychological barrier.
As a former New Yorker I can say with confidence that Hudson is the furtherst out you will experience a sense of Brooklyn. People will still come this far for a long weekend. Nice town none the less.

It just keeps getting more beautiful.
On roads again, surrounded by farmland.
Sometimes gravel.

Back on rail trail.

Tacos.
Now's the time to set up shop on the trail.

Albany sucks.
Motel 6. Mistake. Too far out of town.

### Attacking the Adirondacks

The entire trail until now has been tame.
It could be done easily with most bicycles, but not for much further...

Things started getting tough after Albany.
But more rewarding also.

Elevation-wise, terrain, and in terms of road safety. This is where I think you’d need at least 28mm tyres. I rode 43mm gravel tyres and was thankful or it.
And you also need a solid level of fitness to get through tese never-ending hills.

We stayed in a shipping container.

We swam in Lake Champlain.

We climbed hills and hills and hills.

We got stuck in a ghost town but were lent a car.

Essex town. Willsboro diner interactions.

We crossed the Ausable Chasm.

Got flat after Plattsburgh.

### Onwards to Montréal

Rouses Point is uneventful. Maybe that's the rain talking and making me grumpy.
But the surrounding area is nice. Lakey.
You can see Vermont.

Empire State Trail done. Underwhelimg finish line.
Hello Canada.

<figure>

    alt="TODO">

  </figure>

Good roads and nice drivers, despite the rain.
Nice cycling paths.

Crappy weather but the ride was nice.

Saint Jean-sur-Richelieu.
Cool town.
Walkable. Charming.

Canal bike path on gravel.
Coffee in Chambly.
Busy bike paths.

New-looking bike path from Montréal suburbs direct to town.
Some parts still under construction.

### Montréal itself

I'm glad we rode the extra 1.5 days to Montréal.
It's a beautiful city.
It's also one of the best cities for cycling I've been to, so save some of your energy.
And put aside at least a few days.

Although I expected a B-grade city to rest my legs in, I found myself riding similar distances as during the trail (<span class="distance inline">70 to 100 km</span> per day).
Cycling was just the best way to see the city and get around.

It also seems like _[La Route Verte](https://www.routeverte.com/en/)_ has some promising rides if you wanted to continue on through Québec.

## Other resources

I found these resources helpful during the planning phase of the trip:

- [My Ride With GPS (RWGPS) routes](https://ridewithgps.com/collections/45795?privacy_code=FQSqiW1RcXuLBATK)
  - [Empire State Trail](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/39225143)
  - [Rouses Point to Montréal](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/39236591)
  - [Erie Canalway Trail](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/39236954)
- [Interactive map](https://empiretrail.ny.gov/map)
- [BikeEmpireState Cue Sheets](https://bikeempirestate.com/cue-sheets.aspx)

Once we were on the trail we followed an offline copy of my [RWGPS route](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/39225143) and heeded advice from locals.

Oh, and you should grab a free physical copy of the trail map from the official site’s [Request a Map page](https://empiretrail.ny.gov/request-map).

## Birds

For the twitchers out there: if there were a bird mascot for the trail it would be the [Red-Winged Blackbird](https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/red-winged-blackbird).
It was the only bird that followed us the whole way.
