My brother Lukas and I recently rode the Empire State Trail from Manhattan to Rouses Point and continued on to Montreal, Canada. Here’s a recap and advice for folks planning a similar trip.

You can find my pre-ride Ride With GPS (RWGPS) routes [here](https://ridewithgps.com/collections/45795?privacy_code=FQSqiW1RcXuLBATK) and Strava logs [here](#our-route-in-detail).

## Advice

Here's the bare minimum of what I wish I knew before leaving:

1. Go after Memorial Day
2. Know your daily cadence
3. Warm up before the trip
4. Pack utensils

### 1. Go after Memorial Day

Consider your timing and plan accordingly.
Know that—unless you're in a big town—things are generally shut until Memorial Day (late May). From what I hear, things stay open until at least Labor Day (early September), maybe even Thanksgiving (late November).

If I could do it over, I'd plan to leave New York City a day or two before Memorial Day so I hit the small towns _just_ as they open.
It gets hot and crowded later in June when school breaks up.

We went in early May which turned out to be earlier than most towns were open for season.
That meant we would sometimes struggle to find places to eat or stock up on groceries.
It also limited our range.
For example, we might have taken a ferry to Vermont had we been on the road a few weeks later when that route opened.

### 2. Know your daily cadence

So you can book ahead.

You will likely find yourselves travelling over a weekend, in nice weather, in sparsely populated areas.
Oh, with a big backlog of post-COVID weddings and local show-stoppers like paper mill closures (seriously).
That means accommodation may become sparse.

Figure out how many miles you and your entourage can (or want to) comfortably ride per day and calculate which towns you'll want to stay in.
Make bookings at least a few days ahead (particularly for weekends) so you can adjust your upcoming milage if necessary.
Ideally these bookings are refundable so you have more flexibility.

Our (comfort) cadence ended up being around <span class="distance miles-to-km">40 to 60 miles</span> per day.
That looked like riding from 9:30am to about 3:30pm with plenty of breaks.
Geography permitting, we would alternate the longer days with shorter ones.

Keep in mind that cadence will be affected by elevation. That is a serious factor once you pass Albany and enter the Adarondacs. Use the aforementioned RWGPS route to plan both the distances and elevation gain for each leg.
Google Maps also tends to stick to the Empire State Trail route, for quick calculations.

We didn't figure out our cadence until a few days into the trip and got stung on a Saturday arrival in Hudson, NY where hotels were booked up.
The remaining one was expensive.

### 3. Warm up before the trip

Practice in your full kit and fully-laden bike before the trip.

Get at least one <span class="distance miles-to-km">30 mile</span> ride in or—even better—an overnighter or two.
You might discover parts of your bike (or body) that need adjusting.
It's much better to get injured or experience mechanical issues whilst at home than when on the road, miles from the closest bike shop or hospital.

I accidentally bled my hydraulic brakes when replacing brake pads but did this a few weeks prior so was able to both get it refilled and added to my bicycle mechanic repertoire from the comfort of home.

Lukas wrecked his Achilles by the end of the trip because he was using new cleats and a slightly different saddle height.

### 4. Pack utensils

Every hotel breakfast, cafe, diner, and even restaurant outside the major cities in the US tend to serve food, drink, and condiments in disposable packaging. Regardless of whether you were dining in or taking out.
The amount of landfill we produced was shocking.

I brought metal cutlery and a KeepCup but wish I brought a plate and bowl too.
Having those utensils came in handy on the road too.
Chopping grapefruits, eating half-sandwiches.

## Our route in detail

Technically we did the _Hudson Valley Greenway_ to _Champlain Valley Trail_. We didn't do the _Erie Canalway Trail_ (yet).

Note that we pushed on to Montreal.

### Getting out of the city

We left Battery Park on a Monday morning with a group of friends.

We stopped loading the GPX file on to Lukas’ Garmin after a few days because the trail is so well signposted.
Having a downloaded copy of [the overall RWPGS route](/#) was enough if we ever found ourselves off-course.

### Getting in to Albany

The entire trail until now has been tame.
It could be done easily with most bicycles, but not for much further...

### North of Albany

Things started getting tough after Albany.
Elevation-wise, terrain, and in terms of road safety. This is where I think you’d need at least 28mm tyres. I rode 43mm gravel tyres and was thankful or it.

## Other resources

I found these resources helpful during the planning phase of the trip:

- [My Ride With GPS (RWGPS) routes](https://ridewithgps.com/collections/45795?privacy_code=FQSqiW1RcXuLBATK)
  - [Empire State Trail](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/39225143)

- [Interactive map](https://empiretrail.ny.gov/map)
- [BikeEmpireState Cue Sheets](https://bikeempirestate.com/cue-sheets.aspx)

Once we were on the trail we followed an offline copy of my [RWGPS route](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/39225143) and heeded advice from locals.

Oh, and you should grab a free physical copy of the trail map from the official site’s [Request a Map page](https://empiretrail.ny.gov/request-map).
