We recently rode the Empire State Trail from Manhattan to Rouses Point and continued on to Montreal, Canada. The trip took 11 days at a relaxed riding pace.
What follows is some advice and a route recap for folks planning a similar trip.

You can find my pre-ride Ride With GPS route collection [here](https://ridewithgps.com/collections/45795?privacy_code=FQSqiW1RcXuLBATK) and links to my Strava ride logs [below](#our-route-in-detail).

## Advice

Here's what I wish I knew before leaving:

1. Go after Memorial Day
2. Know your daily cadence
3. Warm up before the trip
4. Pack utensils

### Go after Memorial Day

Consider your timing and plan accordingly.
Know that stores and restaurants in small towns can be shut until Memorial Day (late May). From what I hear, things stay open until at least Labor Day (early September), maybe even Thanksgiving (late November).

If I could do it over, I'd plan to leave New York City a day or two before Memorial Day so I hit the small towns _just_ as they open.
It gets hot and crowded later in June when school breaks up.

We went in early May which turned out to be earlier than most towns were open for season.
That meant we would sometimes struggle to find places to eat or stock up on groceries.
It also limited our range.
For example, we might have taken a ferry to Vermont had we been on the road a few weeks later when that route opened.

### Know your daily cadence

You will likely find yourselves travelling over a weekend, in nice weather, in sparsely populated areas.
Oh, with a big backlog of post-COVID weddings and local show-stoppers like paper mill closures (seriously).
That means accommodation may become sparse.

Figure out how many miles you and your entourage can (or want to) comfortably ride per day and calculate which towns you'll want to stay in.
Make bookings at least a few days ahead (particularly for weekends) so you can adjust your upcoming milage if necessary.
Ideally these bookings are refundable so you have more flexibility.

Our (comfort) cadence ended up being around <span class="distance inline">70 to 100 km</span> per day.
That looked like riding from 9:30am to about 3:30pm with plenty of breaks.
Geography permitting, we would alternate the longer days with shorter ones.

Keep in mind that cadence will be affected by elevation. That is a serious factor once you pass Albany and enter the Adarondacs. Use the aforementioned RWGPS route to plan both the distances and elevation gain for each leg.
Google Maps also tends to stick to the Empire State Trail route, for quick calculations.

We didn't figure out our cadence until a few days into the trip and got stung on a Saturday arrival in Hudson, NY where hotels were booked up.
The remaining one was expensive.

### Warm up before the trip

Practice in your full kit and fully-laden bike before the trip.

Get at least one <span class="distance inline">50 km</span> ride in or—even better—an overnighter or two.
You might discover parts of your bike (or body) that need adjusting.
It's much better to get injured or experience mechanical issues whilst at home than when on the road, miles from the closest bike shop or hospital.

I accidentally bled my hydraulic brakes when replacing brake pads but did this a few weeks prior so was able to both get it refilled and added to my bicycle mechanic repertoire from the comfort of home.

Lukas wrecked his Achilles by the end of the trip because he was using new cleats and a slightly different saddle height.

### Pack utensils

Every hotel breakfast, cafe, diner, and even restaurant outside the major cities in the US tend to serve food, drink, and condiments in disposable packaging. Regardless of whether you were dining in or taking out.
The amount of landfill we produced was shocking.

I brought metal cutlery and a KeepCup but wish I brought a plate and bowl too.
Having those utensils came in handy on the road too.
Chopping grapefruits, eating half-sandwiches.

## Our route in detail

Technically we did the _Hudson Valley Greenway_ to _Champlain Valley Trail_. We didn't do the _Erie Canalway Trail_ (yet).

### Getting out of the city

#### Manhattan to Ardsley

Five of us left The Battery Park [starting point](https://goo.gl/maps/J83fTqYqjVKPQ9oR6) on a Monday morning.
The ride out of the city is briefly difficult between Inwood and the Bronx or, in other words, on the streets between the Hudson River Greenway and Van Cortlandt Park.

</figure>

The scenery is beautiful from here on out.

From here on for the **entirety of the trail** I don’t think we made a wrong turn or felt lost.
The signage for the Empire State Trail is incredible. Just when I felt “hang on, are we going the right way?” creep in my head, I’d see another sign.

We stopped loading the GPX file on to Lukas’ Garmin after a few days because the trail is so well signposted.
Having an offline copy of my [Ride With GPS route](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/39225143) on our phones was good enough if we ever wanted to check.

We spent our first night at a motel in Ardsley.
I chose it because it was a modest distance for our first day (buffering for warming up, flats, and latecomers) and just off the Empire State Trail.
I’d pick somewhere further down next time. Ardsley is still too close to the city and an awkward town for walking for food.

#### Ardsley to Brewster

The next day we rode 42.8 miles to Brewster all along the N Country Trailway.

Had I followed my own advice to ‘know your daily cadence’ I would have pushed on and stayed somewhere more walkable.
The hotel was beautiful but in a bicycle ‘deadzone’.

#### Brewster to Poughkeepsie

This day’s ride was beautiful. Marshy. Dutchess Rail Trail.

Pop into Hopewell Junction for a sandwich.

Poughkeepsie is a weird town. Not much to see here.

Hop on your bike (or grab a cab like we did) to see FDR’s presidential library.

#### Poughkeepsie to Kingston

Take your time crossing the bridge.

Stop into New Paltz for a sandwich and smoothie at X.

A bit of compacted gravel around New Paltz. Leaving New Paltz felt like leaving the city in some ways.
Very beautiful ride.
Cold air pockets that felt like air conditioning but was just an abandoned mine with leftover frost.
Bridges in the middle of nowhere.

Kingston is a nice little town.

Hotel with arcade through the window.

#### Kingston to Hudson

We said goodbye to Myles.

Bard.

On the open road.

Cows. Black bears.

Did I say beautiful?

This is the night we got stung by not heading my ‘know your daily cadence’ advice once more: we had to stay somewhere expensive.

As a former New Yorker I can say with confidence that Hudson is the furtherst out you will experience a sense of Brooklyn. People will still come this far for a long weekend. Nice town none the less.

#### Hudson to Albany

It just keeps getting more beautiful.
On roads again, surrounded by farmland.
Sometimes gravel.

Back on rail trail.

Tacos.

Albany sucks.

Motel 6. Mistake.

### Getting in to Albany

The entire trail until now has been tame.
It could be done easily with most bicycles, but not for much further...

### North of Albany

Things started getting tough after Albany.
Elevation-wise, terrain, and in terms of road safety. This is where I think you’d need at least 28mm tyres. I rode 43mm gravel tyres and was thankful or it.

## Other resources

I found these resources helpful during the planning phase of the trip:

- [My Ride With GPS (RWGPS) routes](https://ridewithgps.com/collections/45795?privacy_code=FQSqiW1RcXuLBATK)
  - [Empire State Trail](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/39225143)
  - [Rouses Point to Montreal](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/39236591)
  - [Erie Canalway Trail](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/39236954)
- [Interactive map](https://empiretrail.ny.gov/map)
- [BikeEmpireState Cue Sheets](https://bikeempirestate.com/cue-sheets.aspx)

Once we were on the trail we followed an offline copy of my [RWGPS route](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/39225143) and heeded advice from locals.

Oh, and you should grab a free physical copy of the trail map from the official site’s [Request a Map page](https://empiretrail.ny.gov/request-map).

## Birds

For the twitchers out there: if there were a bird mascot for the trail it would be the [Red-Winged Blackbird](https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/red-winged-blackbird).
It was the only one we saw all the way up.
