[Not Just Bikes](https://www.youtube.com/c/NotJustBikes/featured) is my new favourite YouTube channel. Here’s a few bits from their [new-ish video on pedestrian urban mobility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ByEBjf9ktY&t=180s):

<figure class="quote">
  <blockquote>
    <p>North American traffic engineers value the convenience of the people who drive more than the lives of the people who walk.</p>
    <p>...in The Netherlands the traffic light for cars is on the near side of the intersection. This means that in order to see the traffic light a driver needs to stop before the zebra crossing.</p>
    <p>...In North America the traffic light is on the far side of the intersection... [which] means that a driver can drive into the zebra crossing and still see the traffic light on the other side... [This] results in this very common situation of a driver blocking the zebra crossing.</p>

And here’s my favourite because it applies as a general design principle:
