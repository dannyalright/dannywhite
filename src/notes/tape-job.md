I rode past this bus stop shelter ad yesterday:

_Photo of OzHarvest billboard about tape._

It made me stop and turn back. Tape? Food waste? Does it detect some kind of odor or turn a certain colour at a specific ripeness?

But it turns out to just be [pre-labelled tape](https://www.ozharvest.org/use-it-up/).

I don't mean to poo-poo effort to cut food waste (which accounts for about a third of our global emissions)... but this reeks of some R/GA brand exercise/solution-looking-for-a-problem fluff which gives people the placebo effect of thinking they are doing good (and therefore causing inaction elsewhere and less legislative accountability).

[Study](https://www.ozharvest.org/app/uploads/2023/05/OzHarvest-Use-It-Up-Tape-Impact-Study.pdf)

- The fact that these people were being studied almost certainly affected their food waste habits, irrespective of the tape
- Almost all the people in the study were female with no kids

I don't have a good answer other than 'it's more complicated than that'.
