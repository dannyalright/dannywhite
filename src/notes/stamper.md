[I wrote last month](/notes/feeling-forward) about 'feeling forward' as a necessary, awkward, step whenever humanity is faced with revolutionary technology.
I mused that we might be able to shorten this step for generative AI in product design by cutting to the task: distilling an interface down to its core task(s) and then working outward.

That sounds obvious but, time and time again, we see products that shoehorn exciting yet unsuitable technology or utilise new technology through an outmoded lens.

What follows is an attempt to fulfil an unoriginal idea—a task—that has so far been too computing intensive or impossible to automate and scale.

Picture (or tune your ears to) this:
you're listening to a podcast episode. One of the speakers suddenly makes an insightful comment that relates directly to a piece of research or area of interest for you.
If only you could snap your fingers and have that insight not only captured but intelligently summarised and interlinked with insights collected elsewhere.

Stamper is a short design exploration—a spike—into this task.
Is it possible to automate?
Does it have utility?

I've used the latest publicly available machine learning models for speech recognition and transcription (Whisper) and large language model for summation and indexing (GPT-4).

Understanding the utility is more interesting to me at this point rather than nailing the automation/engineering/handoff pipeline. so excuse the Wizard of Oz fake connections.
