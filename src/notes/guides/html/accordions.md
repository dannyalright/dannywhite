Using the HTML Details element (`<details>`) is an easy way to add an accordion to a site. It's built-in, well-supported, and easy to use.

```html
<details>
  <summary>A frequently-asked question</summary>
  The expandable answer to that question, which can include any flow content.
</details>
```

You can even [track events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details#Events) on the Details element.

CCS-Tricks has a [good article](https://css-tricks.com/quick-reminder-that-details-summary-is-the-easiest-way-ever-to-make-an-accordion/) on styling the Details element.
