I drove through the solar system a few weeks back.

Missed Pluto and Uranus completely.
I _think_ I saw Saturn but was driving too fast to be sure.
Pluto was uneventful.

Neptune had nice parking.
Here’s a photo:

Anyway.

The one obvious (to me) application for virtual reality is to explore and understand systems bigger or smaller than what can be done practically.
Like a field trip to the solar or vascular system.

‘Real’ reality works just fine, too.
