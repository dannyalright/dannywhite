title: Convert HEIC to JPEG via iOS Shortcuts

I like [HEIC](#) as the default iOS image format but occasionally want to export a JPEG, usually for macOS apps that don’t yet support HEIC. iOS doesn’t let you convert image formats, making this workflow fairly painful.

I got it down to four steps (and a couple of seconds instead of a minute or two) by making an iOS shortcut called Convert to JPEG then AirDrop. You can download it [here](#). Just make sure you tap Edit Actions on your Share Sheet to enable it.

I also made a version of the shortcut that launches the ‘Select photos’ modal instead of relying on the Share Sheet. You can download that one [here](#).
