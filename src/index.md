**Recently** I was the founding product designer at _Future Super_, Australia’s first fossil free super fund. Before that I designed _Kickstarter_'s iOS and Android apps, as well as its [Environmental Resources Center](https://www.kickstarter.com/environment) and web creator tools. I’ve previously helped design apps like [Origami Studio](https://origami.design) and worked with clients including _Meta_, _Airbnb_, _Nike_, _Google_, _City of New York_, and _Unity_.

I believe a designer should understand the grain of their materials and be involved throughout the development process of what they design. I do best on teams that think this way too, so will typically prototype heavily and work closely with engineering.

I’m originally from Sydney, Australia and split my time between there and New York City. In mid-2021 I opened the doors to my freelance design practice. You can see the full details on past work, projects, and education on my [CV page](https://read.cv/dannywhite).
