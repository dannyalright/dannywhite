I’m a multi-disciplinary designer working across digital product and brand. A product designer you might say. Or graphic designer with a penchant for designing software.

I just tell my mum that I make websites and apps look good.

In recent times I have...

- Been the founding product designer at [Future Super](#TODO)
- Led design for Kickstarter’s [iOS and Android](#TODO) apps
- Helped bring Facebook’s [Origami](#TODO) design prototyping tool to life
- Opened Framer’s inaugural [Loupe](#TODO) conference in Amsterdam
